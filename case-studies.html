        <h2 id="introduction"class="case-study-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Renewable Energy Solutions was approached by a local community to design and install a renewable energy system for their community center. The community center was currently using fossil fuels for heating and electricity, and the community wanted to reduce their carbon footprint and save on energy costs.</p>
        <h2 id="problem-statement" class="case-study-title">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The community center was a large building with high energy demands. The community wanted to switch to renewable energy sources but was concerned about the upfront costs and potential reliability issues. They also wanted to ensure that the new system would be easy to maintain and operate.</p>
        <h2 id="solution" class="case-study-title">Solution</h2>
        <p>Renewable Energy Solutions proposed a hybrid renewable energy system that would use a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. The system would be designed to meet the community center's energy demands and would be connected to the grid for backup power. The system would also include a monitoring and control system that would allow the community to track their energy usage and system performance.</p>
        <div class="image-gallery">
          <a href="solar1.jpg" class="image-popup"><img src="solar1.jpg" alt="Solar Panels"></a>
          <a href="wind2.jpg" class="image-popup"><img src="wind2.jpg" alt="Wind Turbines"></a>
          <a href="battery.jpg" class="image-popup"><img src="battery.jpg" alt="Battery Storage"></a>
        </div>
        <h2 id="results" class="case-study-title">Results</h2>
        <p>The hybrid renewable energy system was installed on time and within budget. The community center has seen a significant reduction in their energy costs and has reduced their carbon footprint by over 70%. The system has also proven to be reliable, with minimal maintenance required. The community is pleased with the results and has recommended Renewable Energy Solutions to other local organizations.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion" class="case-study-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Renewable Energy Solutions was able to design and install a hybrid renewable energy system that met the community center's energy demands and reduced their carbon footprint. The system has proven to be reliable and cost-effective, and the community is pleased with the results. This case study demonstrates Renewable Energy Solutions' expertise in designing and installing renewable energy systems for commercial and public buildings.</p>
