        <h1>Resources Library</h1>
        <p>Our project addresses key challenges faced by civil and electrical engineers in the field of renewable energy. One major problem is the lack of accessible and collaborative platforms tailored to their needs. Our solution is a user-friendly website that serves as a centralized resource hub, offering educational materials, interactive tools, and a global community. The goal is to empower engineers to overcome hurdles such as limited resources and fragmented information. Anticipated outcomes include enhanced collaboration, improved skill development, and streamlined access to the latest advancements. By providing a solution that fosters learning, innovation, and community engagement, our project seeks to positively impact the effectiveness and efficiency of engineers working towards a sustainable energy future.</p>
